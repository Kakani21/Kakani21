- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kakani21
- 👀 I’m interested in backed development and bulding scalable systems with Golang.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go internals, microservices architecture, and container orchestration with kubernetes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source Go projects, backend APIs, and distributed systems.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me on kakani2789@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy optimizing code for performance almost as much as I enjoy Chai ☕
